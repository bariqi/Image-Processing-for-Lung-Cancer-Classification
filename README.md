# Image-Processing-for-Lung-Cancer-Classification

In this project, we try to implement some image processing algorithm for lung cancer classification using matlab. From low, medium, until high level processing. The data that we used is obtained from http://www.via.cornell.edu/lungdb.html. Several image processing step that we used as follows:
1. Gabor filter for image enhancement
2. Marker controlled watershed with masking for image segmentation
3. Binarization for image classification

The project is simple computer vision technique, and as an introduction for beginners. There is no metrics performance due to restriction of image label class.

To run the program, you need matlab. You can use one sample image that I upload. For another image you can download from http://www.via.cornell.edu/lungdb.html. To help with my academic interests, you can review my related paper, namely Image processing based detection of lung cancer on CT scan images
